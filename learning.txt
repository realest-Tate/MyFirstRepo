What I have learned from this course
I have gained a solid understanding of Git basics, including how to initialize repositories, track changes, and manage version control through commands like git add, git commit, and git push. 
I also learned how to fork repositories, allowing me to create my own copy of a project and work on it independently without affecting the original source. Additionally, 
I developed skills in collaboration using Git, such as cloning remote repositories, creating branches, submitting pull requests, and resolving merge conflicts key practices that enable efficient 
teamwork in software development environments
